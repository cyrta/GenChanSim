INTRODUCTION

    The Generic Channel Simulator (GCS) is a software package developed
for the DOD. The GCS is an outgrowth of Wideband HF (WBHF) Ionospheric
modeling and simulation work carried out under Contract
DAAB07-93-C-N651. [1] documents the basis for the HF channel models
developed. The tapped delay line and associated statistical models
employed were of a generic nature and it was found that much of the
software could be employed directly or modified to model other radio
channels, particularly the mobile cellular and non-cellular channels
in the higher frequency bands.

    Thus, under Contract DAAB07-94-C-H601 modifications and additions
were made to allow the simulation of macrocell and microcell channels [2]. A
subset of the software was used to simulate the models adopted by the JTC
as a commercial standard for testing of PCS/Cellular modems. However, the
GCS includes a more realistic simulation of PCS/Cellular channels than the
JTC simulation using the Mixed Discrete/Scatter Model. In addition,
the most recent model development for the GCS [3], has made the
channel simulations more versatile and has increased the types of
channels simulated. Current with the work carried out in [3], software
development and  modifications of the GCS have been carried out by MIT
Lincoln Laboratory under a separate contract [4]. Prior software
development was carried out by the Mitre Corp[2][5].

    At the present time the GCS simulates the following channels:
Cellular/PCS (Macrocell and Microcell), VHF/UHF Mobile-Mobile and
Mobile-Base Station, VHF/UHF Air-Air and Air-Ground, Land Mobile Satellite,
Indoor Channels, and HF Ionospheric. The GCS should provide a useful tool
in the comparative evaluation of communication and detection techniques
over both military and non-military wireless channels.

RUNNING SOFTWARE

   To run the software the user can either use aliases or add an entry into
their path list.

    For convenience, numerous aliases have been defined to allow the user
to move about directories and to run programs more easily.  The
files defining the aliases are in the same directory as this ReadMe
file, called MOTIF.alias and NO_MOTIF.alias.  It is recommended that
the user defines a single alias in his/her .cshrc file that sources
the appropriate one of these .alias files when called.  For example,
the user might include the line 

alias simstart  'source /pathtogenchansim/GenChanSim/MOTIF.alias'

in his/her .cshrc file, where pathtogenchansim is the path to the
loaded software.  Then, the user can go to any desired working
directory, type simstart, and then have all of the alias defined in
MOTIF.alias at his/her fingertips.

    The user will have to edit MOTIF.alias and NO_MOTIF.alias to contain
the correct pathtogenchansim and path to Motif and libraries.  Then,
the user should get into the GenChanSim directory, and type "make" so
that all of the software will be compiled.

Good-luck.
