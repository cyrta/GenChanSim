@/*  snr2loss.c:  Calculates the propagation loss for a given SNR and Tx power
over a given link for a mobile radio communications channel.  Given the
required input parameters, solves for the Lp for the channel.
Accepts as input the following parameters:
	
	Pt:	Transmitter power [watts]
	Lt:	Loss of transmission system from transmitter amplifier to
		input of ideal transmit antenna [dB]
	Gt:	Gain of ideal transmit antenna [dBi]
	Gr:	Gain of ideal receiver antenna [dBi]
	SNR:    SNR at the input to the demodulator[dB]
	Fr:	Noise figure of receiver [dB(kTob)] 
	Lr:     Receiver circuit losses (includes
		losses due to non-ideal antenna and transmission lines,
		receiver front-end.
	Br:	Bandwidth of receiver [Hz]

and outputs:
	Lp:	Path loss [dB]
