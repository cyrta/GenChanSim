     This directory contains default scenario airgroundchan CmdScript files
that can be copied to the user's own directory, edited, and run.

     There are 108 script files set up for air-to-ground channel over
sea default scenarios named seanear1av through seafar3fh.  There are
45 script files set up for air-to-ground channel over land scenarios
named landnear1 through landfar9.  The user should run the program
"whichscen" in order to determine which default scenario to use.
"whichscen" queries the user on aircraft geometry and velocity
configuration, overland versus oversea, land roughness, sea state,
wind speed, antenna power gain, and transmitted signal polarization.
Then, the program answers with the filename of the appropriate Cmdline
script file.

     The words Inputfile.dat, SampRate, Outputfile.dat, and
CarFreq in the script file need to be replaced with user supplied
values before successful execution can take place.  The Scatter Path
Sampling Rate is set to 10 MHz, but can be changed if desired.
