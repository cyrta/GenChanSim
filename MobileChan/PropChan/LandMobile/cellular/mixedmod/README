This directory contains the mixed discrete/scatter path channel model
useful for land mobile communications channels.

The enhancements made to this software were to add the ability for a
data file input for delay power spectrum tapweights and for a data
file input for IIR filter coefficients for the Doppler power spectrum.
Thus, the knowledgeable user can come up with any scatter path model
desired.  This feature is mainly intended so that if another power
spectrum model is formed by someone like Phil Bello, the program is
flexible to handle it without having to rewrite and recompile it.
Matlab is easy to use to generate either data sets.  For the delay
power spectrum, the mixedchan program expects single precision
floating point ascii numbers, where the first entry in the file is
equal to the number of tap weights that follow.  For the Doppler power
spectrum, the IIR filter coefficents should be generated and stored as
instructed here:

The program iir32.c in the tapwgts directory implements a 32nd order
IIR filter for the fading spectrum of the Mobile Radio Channel.  The
tap weight coefficients are read in as doubles.  They are expected to
be stored in the "/mixedmod/tapwgts" directory.  The first coefficient
is the "amplitude" (gain factor) which is tap b(1) as generated in
Matlab.  a(1)=1 in Matlab is not written.  The remainder of the
coefficients are stored in interleaved order: a(2), b(2), a(3), b(3)
.... where the indices indicated here are those used by Matlab.  Thus,
a new fading spectrum can easily be defined by using the 'yulewalk'
function (or any other IIR filter design function) in Matlab and
storing the coefficients in the file in interleaved format and double
precision.

Assuming the coefficients are stored in vectors a and b in Matlab,
this is one way to properly write them to the file:
  
*   c=zeros(1,65);
*   c(1)=b(1);
*   c(2:2:length(c))=a(2:1:length(a));
*   c(3:2:length(c))=b(2:1:length(b));
*   fid=fopen('dopp_filt.coef','w')
*   fwrite(fid,c,'double')
*   

If data entry is selected for either delay power spectrum or Doppler
power spectrum, the filename is entered as a program parameter.

Before MIT Lincoln Laboratory started to modify the "mixedchan,"
formerly known as "mobilechan/macromobilechan" software, only one
makefile existed.  It was found that modifying someone else's software
to do something for which it was never intended was becoming so
burdensome and potentially dangerous, that it was decided to leave the
old "JTCchan, formerly known as "mobilechan," intact and modify
separate source files for the enhancements/additions.

A new libcmd.a was built with a different version of cmdline.c.  To
rebuild the old version, use the cmdline.c.orig file.
