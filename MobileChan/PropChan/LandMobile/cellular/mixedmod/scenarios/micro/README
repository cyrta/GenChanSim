This directory contains default scenario mixedchan CmdScript files
that can be copied to the user's own directory, edited, and run.

     There are 144 script files set up for mixed channel default
scenarios named microscen1a through microscen16i.  (Currently (Feb 8,
1996), files ending in the letters a, d, and g all have the same
exponential tau, files ending in the letters b, e, and h have another
exponential tau, and files ending in the letters c, f, and i have
another exponential tau value.  E.g., all types of areas have the same
exponential tau.) All of these default scenarios have one exponential
scatter path and up to four discrete paths, including a possible
direct path.  The user should run the program "whichscen" in order to
determine which default scenario to use.  "whichscen" queries the user
on environment, amount of delay spread, channel structure, and
relative powers of paths and then answers with the filename of the
appropriate Cmdline script file.  The words Inputfile.dat, SampRate,
Outputfile.dat, VehSpeed, CarFreq, and DopShft in the script file need
to be replaced with user supplied values before successful execution
can take place.  The Scatter Path Sampling Rate is set to 10 MHz, but
can be changed if desired.  The doppler power spectrum selected for
these micro channel scenarios is classic instead of flat.
