This directory contains default scenario mixedchan CmdScript files
that can be copied to the user's own directory, edited, and run.

     There are 9 script files set up for mixed channel models obtained
from path profiles in Cox and Leck references named CoxLeck1 through
CoxLeck9.  These all have one exponential scatter path and up to four
discrete paths.  The words Inputfile.dat, SampRate, Outputfile.dat,
VehSpeed, CarFreq, and DopShft need to be replaced with user supplied
values before successful execution can take place.  The Scatter Path
Sampling Rate is set to 10 MHz, but can be changed if desired.

     There are 144 additional script files set up for mixed channel
default scenarios named scen1a through scen16i.  These all have one
exponential scatter path and up to four discrete paths, including a
possible direct path.  The user should run the program "whichscen" in
order to determine which default scenario to use.  "whichscen" queries
the user on environment, amount of delay spread, channel structure, and
relative powers of paths and then answers with the filename of the
appropriate Cmdline script file.  The words Inputfile.dat, SampRate,
Outputfile.dat, VehSpeed, CarFreq, and DopShft in the script file need
to be replaced with user supplied values before successful execution
can take place.  The Scatter Path Sampling Rate is set to 10 MHz, but
can be changed if desired.
