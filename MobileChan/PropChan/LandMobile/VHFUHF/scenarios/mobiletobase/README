     This directory contains default scenario CmdScript files for a
mobile to base VHF/UHF channel model.  The CmdScripts should be copied
to the user's own directory, edited, and run.  Note that the routine
called in these scripts is mixedchan, because only one node of the
link is mobile; the center frequency should be choosen for the VHF/UHF
band.

     There are 144 script files set up for mixed channel default
scenarios named scen1a through scen16i.  These all have one
exponential scatter path and up to four discrete paths, including a
possible direct path.  The user should run the program "whichscen" in
order to determine which default scenario to use.  "whichscen" queries
the user on the environment, amount of delay spread, channel
structure, and relative powers of paths and then answers with the
filename of the appropriate Cmdline script file.  The words
Inputfile.dat, SampRate, Outputfile.dat, VehSpeed, CarFreq, and
DopShft in the script file need to be replaced with user supplied
values before successful execution can take place.  The Scatter Path
Sampling Rate is set to 10 MHz, but can be changed if desired.
