     This directory contains CmdScript files for a mobile to mobile
VHF/UHF channel model.  The CmdScripts should be copied to the user's
own directory, edited, and run.  The routine called in these scripts
is vhfuhfmixedchan.

     There are 144 script files set up for the VHF/UHF mixed channel
default scenarios named microscen1a through microscen16i.  These all
have one exponential scatter path and up to four discrete paths,
including a possible direct path.  The user should run the program
"whichscen" in order to determine which default scenario to use.
"whichscen" queries the user on the environment, amount of delay
spread, channel structure, and relative powers of paths and then
answers with the filename of the appropriate Cmdline script file.  The
words Inputfile.dat, SampRate, Outputfile.dat, MaxVehSpeed, CarFreq,
and DopShft in the script file need to be replaced with user supplied
values before successful execution can take place.  Also, one of the
four choices for "a," the vehicle speed ratio, must be chosen by
deleting the comment symbol at the front of the desired line.  The Scatter
Path Sampling Rate is set to 10 MHz, but can be changed if desired.
