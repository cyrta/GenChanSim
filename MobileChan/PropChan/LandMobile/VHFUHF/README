Before MIT Lincoln Laboratory started to modify the
mobilechan/macromobilechan software, only one makefile existed.  It
was found that modifying someone else's software to do something for
which it was never intended was becoming so burdensome and potentially
dangerous, that it was decided to leave the old mobilechan intact and
modify separate source files for the enhancements/additions.

Consequently, the original makefile makes the old versions as we
received them, and 'make_new_macro' compiles and links the modified
macromobilechan.  The original sources have been saved with a ".orig"
extension, so if for some reason it should become necessary to rebuild
the old versions, those source files which have a ".orig" extension
should be copied into the ".c" file before issuing the 'make' command.

Similarly, a new libcmd.a was built with a different version of cmdline.c.
To rebuild the old version, use the cmdline.c.orig file. 

The current versions used for the modified software are all saved in
files with a ".new" extension.
